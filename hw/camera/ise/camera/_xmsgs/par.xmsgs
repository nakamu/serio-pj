<msg type="warning" file="ConstraintSystem" num="0" >The Offset constraint &lt;TIMEGRP &quot;CAM_INPUTS&quot; OFFSET = IN 30 ns BEFORE COMP &quot;xipCAM_PCLK&quot; &quot;RISING&quot;;&gt; [top.pcf(449)], is specified without a duration.  This will result in a lack of hold time checks in timing reports.  If hold time checks are desired a duration value should be specified following the &apos;VALID&apos; keyword.
